","","shipbuilders, Working world","","","Shipbuilders","","","","Democrats hammered on the safety record of one of the Navy’s top shipbuilders, the subject of a recent story by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting on the Senate floor.

“With so much taxpayer money on the line, it really matters that contractors are using it responsibly,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., told the Senate.

Warren cited a string of accidents involving VT Halter Marine Inc., a major Navy shipbuilder that was the focus of the Reveal investigation, as a stark example of why tax dollars should not go to dangerous companies.
Echoing Warren’s concerns, Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., also touched on the accidents in the Reveal article.

“VT Halter is a major Navy shipbuilder,” Franken told the Senate. “But its safety track record is deeply concerning.”

Franken recounted how a month after the 2009 explosion, VT Halter received an $87 million contract from the Navy. It then settled with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, admitting it had willfully broken 12 safety rules. Workers said fans and explosion-proof lights that would have prevented the blast were locked away to save money.

“It doesn’t make sense to keep rewarding companies like this with lucrative contracts when they repeatedly and … willfully disregard basic safety protections,” Franken said.
